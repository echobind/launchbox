# launchbox

Initial spike at something similar to Ember's blueprints, but using provided configurations for flexibility. This started as a way to generate files for React / React Native, but could work in any JavaScript project.

## Goals
1. Get a team to decide on file structure, filenames, etc
2. Set up the config or install a plugin with an out of the box config
3. Override default templates in consuming app with whatever you want
4. Run commands to generate things `launchbox g component --pascalCase`, `launchbox d component`

## Random name trivia
